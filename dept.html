                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    As manufacturing activities play a major role in the development of the country, PSG College of Technology envisaged the need for trained manpower in the field of manufacturing and thus, the undergraduate programme in Production Engineering was started in the year 1975. Subsequently, the department grew in several dimensions of academic excellence with time. The programme has been accredited for five years in the year 2012 by the National Board of Accreditation for maintaining its previous accreditation status. All the laboratories of the department are approved for carrying out research, leading to Ph.D Degree (full time and part time) programmes by Anna University, Chennai and under QIP-AICTE, New Delhi. A good number of researchers receive Ph.D through Anna University, Chennai by pursuing research in the department under Full time / Part time modes.
                    <br><br>
                    The department offers consultancy in manufacturing processes, design and testing a range of products, including product styling. The department maintains a close liaison with a large number of universities and industries within the country and across overseas through faculty research and collaborative projects. The teams of dedicated faculty members nurture the programme and actively contribute towards the creation of a persuasive and a high quality learning environment. There is a strong interaction with industry majors like M/s Larsen & Toubro, General Electric, Bangalore, Ashok Leyland, TAFE, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and a few more.
                    <br><br>
                    As the BE Programme in Production Engineering (Regular) was received well by the industry, an innovative planning resulted in the creation of BE-Production Engineering (Sandwich) programme, in the year 2002. The students of this programme undergo industrial training in addition to the academic process that is provided in the regular BE programme. As a result, the students are equipped with skills that make them ready to be deployed on the job. They undergo internships in several industries. There is a well-planned curriculum for industrial training that smoothly transforms the students to an employable professional.
